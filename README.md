This is Everlance Ruby on Rails Challenge. 
To test this, you can run your server (`rails server`) and make calls from a tool Postman or Insomnia. Rspec tests also help to understand and test code.

Some features and refactors were mapped to be done later, and are listed below. 


## TODO
* Add rubocop;
